# Programming Assignment 2: SQL

## Deadline: Xth October, midnight (CST).

### Assignment guideline
- This folder contains **5 SQL** files
- Your task is to complete the SQL queries in each file. Look for patterns like `-- Task X.Y`, for example:
```shell
-- Task 1.1
-- Task 1.2
...
```
You have to implement **20 SQL queries** across the 5 SQL files.
- Each query is worth 5.5 points, totaling 110 points. There is no explicit bonus points here, you get all 20 queries right, you get 10 bonus points (110 out of 100).
- **DO NOT MODIFY ANY DATA, DATABASE NAME OR TABLE STRUCTURES**
- **COLUMN NAMES SHOULD EXACTLY MATCH THE `Output column titles` MENTIONED IN EACH QUERY**
- (Optional) You can import each SQL file to your local MySQL server:
```shell
mysql -u root -p < task1.sql
mysql -u root -p < task2.sql
mysql -u root -p < task3.sql
mysql -u root -p < task4.sql
mysql -u root -p < task5.sql
```

## Gradescope submission instructions
- Submit the SQL files on Gradescope.
- There are 20 test cases. For each test case, you will see `test_case_task_<TASK_NUMBER>_<PROBLEM_NUMBER> (test_SQL_Queries.TestFunctions) (5.5/5.5)` if it passes the testcase.   
- If you have Gradescope access issue, send a message with your First name, Last name, and UIC email address. We will add you manually.
